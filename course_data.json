Especially when you need to deploy lots and lots of applications?\n\nIf so, this course is just for you. You’ll learn about Helm, a popular, CNCF graduated project that's built on top of Kubernetes. Helm is a Kubernetes package manager which helps bundle all K8s objects together. In this course, you’ll create small projects to learn about the basic concepts of Helm and gain hands-on experience in working with it. You’ll also learn how to design reusable Helm charts.\n\nBy the time you’re done with this course, you’ll be equipped with the skills required to make reliable, consistent, and scalable deployments with Helm. You’ll be able to use Helm to create, package, configure, and deploy your Kubernetes applications efficiently and effectively.",
